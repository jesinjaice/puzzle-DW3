**Code Smells**

1. The naming convention of variables for below files are not proper.
    `book-search.component.html`
    `book-search.component.ts`
    `reading-list.component.html`
2.  In `book-search.component.html`, `submit` event was added for submit form but as it is reactive form the best practice is to use ngSubmit which provides form validation before sending the request.
3.  In file `book-search.component.html`, the template contains a date function to change the format of the date. 
4. To prevent memory leak we can use an async pipe instead of subscription, for retrieving books. By adding '| async' pipes the subscriptions are handled automatically so there is no need to unsubscribe manually.
5. In file `total-count.component.ts`, we can remove the ngOnInit() lifecycle hook since it is not utilized. We should not import Angular lifecycle hooks without their utilization.
6. In file `book-search.component.html`, for proper accessibility, buttons should be represented with a <button> tag rather than an anchor tag with a (click) listener. An anchor tag is primarily used to create links between pages. While a button is used for on page functionality.

**Improvements**

1. Fixed the naming conventions for variables in above mentioned files.
2. Changed `submit` to `ngSubmit` as it is best practice.
3. Replaced the date function with Angular Date pipe. The date pipe offers a convenient way to format dates without the need for complex logic or function. This imporves perfomance.
4. Added `| async` pipes to prevent memory leaks.
5. Removed lifecycle hooks that are not utilized.
6. Replaced Anchor tag with Button.


**Accessibility**

**Automated Lighthouse Scan Issues**

1. Buttons do not have an accessible name
2. Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.


**Manual Checks**

1. Added alt-text for book-covers image.
2. `Javascript` is wrapped in an anchor tag in `book-search.component.html`. Change it to a button element.
3. Added `aria-label` to the `Search icon` to make this more meaningful for the user.
4. Added darker effects for `Reading list` and `Want to read` so that it will provide a hover effect to the buttons. 
5. The buttons can be made visually focusable and accessible. The closing button of the reading list in `app.component.html` is made focusable by adding outline in `app.component.scss`.
6. Added `aria-label` for the `Want to read` button to make it read with the book name.
